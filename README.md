What is this?
=============

SVG2ObjC is designed to integrate with the XCode build system to allow SVG graphics to be used as part of an OSX or iOS app.
The SVG files are added to the project and then a custom build rule is used to produce the output Objective-C code.  This code can then be used in your app to render the graphics described by the SVG file.

Limitations
===========

Currently the code only handles a tiny subset of the SVG standard, however adding new element types should be fairly straight forward.
